NYC Transit Clustering plus Recommendation Engine
-
- Data Source: 2018 Citywide Mobility Survey of New York City residents' travel choices and behaviors (NYC Open Data)

Goal
-
- Create clusters of types of trips taken throughout New York City
- Compare trips within clusters to find a viable mass transit alternative for trips completed by car
- Motivation: If another person has completed a trip similar to your car trip using mass transit instead, you might consider doing the same!

Data Processing
-
- Remove unrelated features and features with sparse data available
- Impute missing values using mode for categorical data, median for numerical data
- Normalize numerical features
- One-hot-encode categorical features

EDA
-
- There was no extreme variation in transit mode between days of the week
